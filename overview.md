# Some Machine Learning Projects
# 1)Logistic Regression on Titanic and Breast Cancer Datasets
In this project, we predict the chances of survival of each and ever person present on the ship. Also, we identify how to remove unwanted data from the dataset.

# 2)Decision Tree on Iris Dataset
In this project, we learn how to apply parameters of decision tree to solve the probelms on the Iris dataset.

# 3)Text Classification on 20 Newsgroups Dataset
This project helps us to apply real applications of machine learning. Here, we understand how can classification work on a dataset which is related to daily life encounters with news. We can also see how certain changes in the project can help us in filtering out content and projecting only relevent pieces of information
